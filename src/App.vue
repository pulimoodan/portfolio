      <Narration>
        <p>
          Started from my high school, curious about games and computers, I've
          tried everything found interesting to me until I realized that
          <Highlight> web development</Highlight>
          is my favourite ‚≠ê.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was doing
          <Highlight>freelance</Highlight>
          web designing and development ‚å®Ô∏è (mostly static websites) during my
          <Highlight>high school</Highlight>, to buy my first personal computer
          üñ•Ô∏è and accessories. Yes, I've learnt web development with my old
          smartphone üì± and eventually my friend helped me with his computer to
          deliver my freelance gigs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <Highlight>Game development</Highlight>
          üéÆ was the main attraction for me to get into technologies and still
          I'm trying out things and making games as a
          <Highlight>hobby</Highlight>
          (I must say, I'm not an expert).

          New <Highlight>tech stacks</Highlight> and

          <Highlight>Writing</Highlight> stories and poems (also
          <Highlight>reading</Highlight>) was my hobbies since my childhood in
          which I still think I had a knack (I'm not saying this out of self
          confidence, I still regret that I became a software engineer instead
          of a world famous <Highlight>author</Highlight>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Somewhere in the period of building my career, I lost my skills on
          writing and now, trying to redevelop that, reading a lot and imagining
          a lot (I won't spend valuable time looking at the ceiling).
        </p>
        <p>
          I write <Highlight>blog</Highlight> posts nowadays, mostly technical
          things: challenges faced in development, new features or tools I
          discovered, new tools or solutions I built, and so on.

          Got my first <Highlight>offer letter</Highlight> at the final year of
          my <Highlight>high school</Highlight>, while I was preparing for my
          exams. I was so much excited about the industry and realized that it
          was the best opportunity to start exploring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Signed that offer letter after my exams and I was ready to go. Almost
          everyone from my family and friends were concerned about me choosing a
          job over higher education, but I was already figured out my future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Studying <Highlight>Bachelor of Computer Application</Highlight> at
          <Highlight>Manipal University</Highlight> along with my job now, which
          is almost manageable by a 21 year old. Here is my
          <Highlight>career roadmap</Highlight> :

          Designing and developing <Highlight>static websites</Highlight> was
          the primary gigs I could handle when I started freelancing web
          development. One of my friends' brother had an
          <Highlight>ERP</Highlight> development company and they out-sourced
          web development projects, of which I ended up the main contender.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, I got a project from a start-up which was a
          <Highlight>web app</Highlight> with almost
          <Highlight>3K+ users</Highlight>, I could complete it in a few months
          which is running flawlessly until now. Still building projects to
          solve problems of my own or faced by others.
